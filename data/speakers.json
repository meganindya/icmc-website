    "topic": "Outsourcing computations to a cloud that you don't trust",
    "abstract": "In this talk, we discuss the problem of outsourcing computations to untrusted servers in multiple settings (i.e., multiple clients, multiple servers). More precisely, we discuss three new cryptographic primitives, verifiable homomorphic secret sharing, homomorphic multi-key authenticators and homomorphic signcryption. The first two can be used when multiple clients want to outsource joint computations, while the third when both verifiability and proof of the data&#39;s authenticity need to be provided. We provide highlights on the proposed cryptographic constructions and discuss the main challenges that are overcome when we employ them."

    "abstract": "Following are the issues in e-voting.\n\n1. Voter authentication i.e. each registered voter votes her own vote; no one else can.\n2. Each voter is able to verify if her vote has been cast as intended.\n3. Each voter is able to verify if her vote is recorded as cast.\n4. Anyone can verify if all the votes are tallied as recorded.\n5. If multiple EVMs are used, the voting pattern in each machine is not disclosed; only the SUM over all the machines are disclosed.\n\nWill discuss possible solutions to address all the issues."

    "topic": "Time-Memory Trade-off Attack",
    "abstract": "In the late seventies, after acceptance of DES as the encryption standard, Martin Hellman [4] proposed a time-memory tradeoff (TMTO) attack on DES. Babbage [1] and Goli´c [3] proposed time-memory tradeoffs for stream ciphers. Biryukov and Shamir [2] combined these approaches and proposed an improved time-memory-data tradeoff (TMDO) for stream ciphers. We will discuss these attack principles and some recent results that we have obtained for stream ciphers.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. S.
